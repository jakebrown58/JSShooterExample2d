## About

It's a shooter game - inspired by darts.  You have target areas to hit, and a limited time to hit them.  The catch is you also have to manage your own accuracy, because your crosshairs aren't fully under your control.

Try to hit all the targets before time expires - but watch out - misses burn time off the clock and throw off your aim.
